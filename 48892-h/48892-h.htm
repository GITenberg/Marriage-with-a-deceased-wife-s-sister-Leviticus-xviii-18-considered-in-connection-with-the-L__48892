<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,</p>
<p>The deep interest which for a long period you have taken in
preserving intact our Table of Degrees as to prohibited
marriages, will, I hope, sufficiently account for my wish to
address the following remarks to your Lordship, and your
unvarying kindness will no less account for the ready permission
which you have given me to do so.&nbsp; I will not take up any
time in preface further than just to observe that of course you
are not in any way responsible for the views or the argument of
the ensuing pages, though I am, I hope, justified in believing
that, whatever be their imperfections, the object at which they
aim will meet with your sympathy and approval.&nbsp; My earnest
and anxious wish is to do what I may, God helping me, to aid in
averting what I feel would be a grievous sin if our marriage law
were altered in the sense desired by the promoters of the
Wife&rsquo;s Sister&rsquo;s Marriage Bill.&nbsp; I do not purpose
to go over the whole ground which has been so often contested,
(to do which would be almost an impertinence in remarks addressed
to your Lordship), but rather to confine my observations to the
Scriptural <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>argument, or, perhaps I should say, to a portion of the
Scriptural argument against the change proposed, viz.&mdash;to
the due sense and application of the 18th verse of the xviii.
chapter of Leviticus.</p>
<p>There is, I suppose, no room for reasonable doubt that the
case of the advocates of a change in our law which may sanction
the marriage of a man with his deceased wife&rsquo;s sister,
rests mainly, so far as the Scriptural argument is concerned,
upon the 18th verse of the xviii. chapter of Leviticus.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex her,
to uncover her nakedness, beside the other, in her life
time,&rdquo; where, the translation being assumed to be correct,
the interpretation put upon it is that if such a union is
forbidden in the life time of the first wife, there is a tacit
sanction of the same after her decease.&nbsp; If it were not for
this one verse thus translated and thus interpreted, there would,
I think, hardly be a question raised or a doubt felt by one in a
thousand that such unions are prohibited, denounced as
incestuous, and forbidden under God&rsquo;s general law, just as
we find them set down in Archbishop Parker&rsquo;s table of
prohibited degrees.</p>
<p>The importance, then, of this verse being admitted as to the
right understanding of God&rsquo;s will in this matter, I propose
briefly to call attention to some points connected with it which
I think have not received the consideration to which they are
entitled.&nbsp; My aim will be to show, even conceding the whole
demand as to the correctness of the translation found in the Text
of our authorized version, and not disputing the inference that
there is a certain tacit sanction of such a Union with the second
sister after the death of the first, yet that upon a careful
consideration, it may most reasonably be maintained that the
sanction does not extend to any general permission of the same,
but that the enactment or permission is made <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>and given for
one special object only, and is limited to one particular
condition of things, incident only to the Jewish economy, to meet
which it is definitely designed and restricted; that therefore it
involves, rightly understood, no contradiction at all to the law
laid down generally that none shall approach to any near of kin
to him (v. 6), nor to the cases which follow illustrating the
meaning of that law (v. 7&ndash;17), nor, therefore to the
prohibitions generally, nor to that one among them particularly,
that a woman shall not marry two brothers&mdash;extended by
direct analogy to the converse case, that a man shall not marry
two sisters; in other words, that though the translation, and the
inference to a certain extent, be both conceded, yet there is an
ample and true sense for the passage, and full scope for its
intention and enactment, without its for a moment clashing with
the prohibitions of the general law.</p>
<p>But first I would say a word to clear the position that but
for this 18th verse of the xviii. chapter of Leviticus, no one
would doubt, as to the prohibition in question.</p>
<p>How does the case stand?&nbsp; The xviii. chapter of Leviticus
deals first (as the heading states), with &ldquo;unlawful
marriages.&rdquo;&nbsp; After declaring emphatically, in the
first five verses, the importance of keeping God&rsquo;s law, and
warning the people against falling into the sins of the Egyptians
and the Canaanites, the matter itself is opened in the 6th
verse&mdash;&ldquo;None of you shall approach to any that is near
of kin to him to uncover their nakedness: I am the
Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;This,&rdquo; as you, my lord, observed
at the meeting at Willis&rsquo;s Rooms, (February 1st, 1860,)
&ldquo;is the key-note to all that follows.&nbsp; The law then
shows who are near of kin to us, and proceeds to mention more
cases of affinity than of relationship by blood.&rdquo; <a
name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5"
class="citation">[5]</a>&nbsp; I am aware that it has been
contended on philological grounds that the terms &ldquo;near of
kin&rdquo; are <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>necessarily confined in their sense to kindred by blood
relationship, and cannot embrace relationship by marriage; but I
do not feel that there is any material weight in the critical
examination of such a passage, as to the general use of a phrase
or word, because it seems to me we have here the comment of the
Holy Ghost Himself in what follows as to the sense in which the
words &ldquo;near of kin&rdquo; are, in the connection in which
they there stand, to be understood; that is to say, that which
follows gives, by the details of the enactments ensuing,
God&rsquo;s own comment as to what is intended by &ldquo;near of
kin,&rdquo; and if these details be found to embrace affinity as
well as, and as much as, blood relationship, it appears to me
that the consideration of what in other cases is the usage of the
term, must be beside the question we have before us.&nbsp; Nay,
is it not, indeed, very probable that terms, which in their
ordinary usage would refer simply to blood relationship, are here
chosen by Divine inspiration to include also relationship by
affinity, for the very purpose of showing that a man and his wife
being one flesh, the nearness of kin here contemplated, and
illustrated by the instances which follow, was to embrace both
relationships alike?&nbsp; I do not know how better to shew that,
in the whole connection of this passage, the enactment is of the
kind which I have mentioned, than by a quotation from the
pamphlet of Mr. Keble, published in 1849.&nbsp; Though, my lord,
you and others have said the same things, you will, I am sure,
bear with me whilst I recall the passage as it stands in the
words of that revered writer.&nbsp; After shewing the scope of
the law to extend not merely to the Jews by the curse which it
entails having been brought upon the very heathen who gave way to
such iniquities, he says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Now, what are the customs which were so
abominable in the old inhabitants of God&rsquo;s Holy Land, and
caused the <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>land itself to vomit them out? (the customs, I mean, in
respect of marriage: for of the other horrors mentioned in this
chapter we are not now compelled to speak.)&nbsp; They are all
forbidden in one general principle: &lsquo;None of you shall
approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover their
nakedness: I am the Lord.&rsquo;&nbsp; This being laid down in
the 6th verse, the following verses allege so many instances,
whereby God&rsquo;s people might understand what &lsquo;near of
kin&rsquo; means.&nbsp; And it is remarkable, that in this
enunciation the law makes no distinction between those who are
akin by marriage and those who are akin by blood, but mentions
them indiscriminately, as if the one sort were precluded from
marrying under the same penalties as the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For these are the degrees expressly forbidden, in their
order.&nbsp; First, a natural mother, in v. 7.&nbsp; Next, a
father&rsquo;s wife, or step-mother, in v. 8: which is the case
mentioned in 1 Cor. v. 1.&nbsp; Next, a sister, v. 9.&nbsp; Next,
a grand-daughter, v. 10.&nbsp; Next, a half-sister, v. 11.&nbsp;
Next, an aunt by the father&rsquo;s side, v. 12.&nbsp; Next, an
aunt by the mother&rsquo;s side, v. 13.&nbsp; Next, an aunt by
marriage with an uncle, v. 14.&nbsp; Next, a son&rsquo;s wife, v.
15.&nbsp; Next, a brother&rsquo;s wife, v. 16.&nbsp; Next, a
wife&rsquo;s daughter, mother, or grand-daughter, v. 17.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here are thirteen cases in all: six of kindred by
blood, and seven of kindred by marriage: and neither by the order
in which they follow one another, nor by any difference of
expression regarding them, is any hint given, that the one sort
of profanation is less heinous in God&rsquo;s sight than the
other.&nbsp; The world may have come to think there is a
difference, because the world will not believe that man and wife
are really one flesh.&nbsp; But the written law of God apparently
deals with both alike.&rdquo; <a name="citation7"></a><a
href="#footnote7" class="citation">[7]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>He then
adds:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The next remark I have to make on this,
which is God&rsquo;s own table of prohibited marriages, is one
which it seems to me that no fair mind can deny.&nbsp; Indeed,
one is half ashamed to enounce it, it is so obvious: yet the
reasoning on the other side appears to be mainly based on the
denial of it.&nbsp; It is simply this: that nearness of kin not
being affected by sex, what is forbidden to a man is forbidden to
a woman in the same degree of kindred or affinity, though it be
not set down in words.&nbsp; For instance, in v. 7, a man is
forbidden to marry his mother: then, by the same rule, a woman is
forbidden to marry her father, though the prohibition is not
expressed.&nbsp; Surely it would be fearful paltering with
God&rsquo;s law, not to accept and obey such a plain rule as
this.&nbsp; And it is to be observed, that these Canons are all
addressed to men only: the woman&rsquo;s duty and the
woman&rsquo;s sin are left to be inferred in each case: but what
should we think of the woman who should therefore account herself
left at liberty, so far as the Levitical laws are concerned?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now look at v. 16; which, being expressed in such
English as we now commonly talk, would run, I suppose, as
follows: &lsquo;Thou shalt not marry thy brother&rsquo;s widow:
she is one flesh with thy brother, and is therefore thine own
sister.&rsquo;&nbsp; Can any other interpretation be put upon it?
and if this be the right interpretation, are not marriages with a
brother&rsquo;s widow plainly forbidden among the Canaanitish
abominations?&rdquo; <a name="citation8"></a><a href="#footnote8"
class="citation">[8]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>All this appears to me not only a fair and right explanation,
with no unwarrantable deductions or inferences, but one
absolutely irrefutable, unless God Himself have marked in some
other place a dispensation or exception to be made to it.&nbsp; I
know such dispensation or exception is just what is
claimed.&nbsp; To deal with such allegation is the very object <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>of my
addressing you, and I shall shortly come to that part of my
subject.&nbsp; But it may not be amiss here just to call
attention to the fact that Dr. M&rsquo;Caul himself (whom I think
I may designate as the most learned and able of the advocates for
the change of the law in question) seems to admit that, were
there no other Scripture to override the law as thus proclaimed,
he should acknowledge the force of this part of the xviii.
chapter of Leviticus as conclusive on the unlawfulness of
marriage with the deceased wife&rsquo;s sister; for he says
expressly, in his first letter on the subject, addressed to the
Rev. W. H. Lyall, &ldquo;On some points, I think, we agree; as,
for instance, that the final appeal in questions relating to
marriage must be to the Word of God. . . . I also am convinced
that the laws in Leviticus xviii., being a part of the moral law,
stand on a totally different footing from circumcision, or the
Jewish Sabbaths, or abstinence from meats.&nbsp; Indeed, I
believe that this marriage law was given to the Gentile Churches
in the famous decree of the Council of Jerusalem.&nbsp; On this
ground, I believe that the prohibitions of Leviticus xviii. are
binding on all Christians.&rdquo;&nbsp; That is, he believes,
that the general law then given, as being of a moral nature, and
intended for all men, was distinctly re-enacted, and re-decreed
for the sake of greater perspicuity, by the Christian Church in
the Council at Jerusalem.&nbsp; And he goes on&mdash;&ldquo;I
agree, further, with those who interpret &lsquo;woman&rsquo; or
&lsquo;wife&rsquo; in these prohibitions as comprehending
widowhood, so that these females are prohibited, not only during
the lives of their husbands, but absolutely and
forever.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he adds&mdash;&ldquo;And, lastly, I
admit that from the prohibited marriages enumerated, compared
with other parts of the Divine legislation, others not enumerated
may be pronounced unlawful.&rdquo; <a name="citation9"></a><a
href="#footnote9" class="citation">[9]</a>&nbsp; Where we may see
that, although with a certain <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>reserve, yet the principle of arguing
from analogy, and from a case to its converse, in regard to sex,
appears to be admitted.&nbsp; And I think I do not misrepresent
the whole tone and sense of the two letters of Dr. M&rsquo;Caul,
when I say that I am convinced, but for the 18th verse of the
xviii. chapter, he would himself readily have allowed the full
weight of Mr. Keble&rsquo;s statement, and considered these
unions to be absolutely prohibited.</p>
<p>But next as to the exception claimed.&nbsp; It is true that
there is an exception to the working of the law laid down in
verse 16, concerning the brother&rsquo;s wife, by a positive
enactment in Deuteronomy (chap. xxv. v. 5&ndash;10), where
provision is made for a man &ldquo;raising up seed unto his
brother,&rdquo; by taking to him his widow to wife, if the
brother have died childless, that &ldquo;the first-born which she
beareth&rdquo; may &ldquo;succeed in the name of his brother,
which is dead, that his name be not put out of Israel&rdquo; (v.
6.)&nbsp; But I feel justified in saying that this alone would
have been no difficulty to Dr. M&rsquo;Caul (nor to any man of
his reasoning powers), as to the prevalence of the general law in
all cases but the special one excepted, and that but for the 18th
verse of the xviii. chapter of Leviticus, our 99th Canon and the
table of prohibited degrees would have been almost or quite
universally accepted as the true enunciation of the will and law
of God in this matter of unlawful marriages.</p>
<p>It is, then, to that particular passage of Holy Scripture that
it is necessary to draw attention.&nbsp; And here, my lord, I
must take up a word, which I find in your speech before referred
to, which seems to me to be emphatically a word &ldquo;of truth
and soberness.&rdquo;&nbsp; You say, &ldquo;To over-ride a
command, which is distinct and precise, you must have a very
clear verse and a very clear interpretation.&rdquo; <a
name="citation10"></a><a href="#footnote10"
class="citation">[10]</a>&nbsp; Dr. M&rsquo;Caul quotes these
words, with a distinct approval of their <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>statement,
though with exactly the converse of their application.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You believe,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;that a very clear
verse and a very clear interpretation might over-ride a command,
even though it be distinct and precise, and you are
right.&rdquo;&nbsp; He goes on, &ldquo;Lev. xviii. 16, the verse
on which you chiefly rest your Scriptural arguments, is, so far
as relates to marriage with a brother&rsquo;s wife, distinct and
precise, and enunciates a command absolutely and without any
limitation; and yet it is over-ridden by Deut. xxv.
5.&rdquo;&nbsp; He means, of course, over-ridden as to the
particular case of &ldquo;a man&rsquo;s raising up seed unto his
brother;&rdquo; but not so as to sanction the brother taking the
brother&rsquo;s wife in any other contingency.&nbsp; And this we,
as well as he, allow and admit, for who shall limit the
Almighty&rsquo;s right, and power to grant or make any special
exceptions to His general laws, which He may think fit?&nbsp; But
we should have deemed it strange indeed if the whole law enacted
in one place were definitely repealed in another, whilst that law
was in force among those for whom it was given and
designed.&nbsp; But so far we can well go with Dr.
M&rsquo;Caul.&nbsp; He proceeds, where, as I hope presently to
shew, we have no need to follow him, and where, indeed, if his
view were correct, there <i>would be</i> the total repeal of what
is stated as the law in one verse, in the second verse after
it.&nbsp; However, to go on,&mdash;Dr. M&rsquo;Caul adds,
&ldquo;And therefore, <i>a fortiori</i>, your inferential
prohibition with regard to a wife&rsquo;s sister may be
over-ridden also by a clear verse and a clear
interpretation.&nbsp; If weight of authority is to decide, Lev.
xviii. 18, is just such a verse, and its interpretation has the
required condition.&nbsp; Here, then, the controversy narrows
itself into that which is the common and popular view of the
matter: whether the inferential prohibition from verse 16 is to
over-ride the expressed command of verse 18, or the plain letter
of this latter verse to over-ride the inference from the
former.&rdquo; <a name="citation11"></a><a href="#footnote11"
class="citation">[11]</a>&nbsp; Now, I shall <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>have
something further to say presently as to &ldquo;the expressed
command,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;plain letter of this latter
verse;&rdquo; but at present let me merely remark, that we have,
at any rate, Dr. M&rsquo;Caul&rsquo;s admission that between
these two verses there <i>is a conflict and an
over-riding</i>.&nbsp; In his view even, there is
discrepancy.&nbsp; What is, in the one, he tells us, at least
inferentially prohibited, is, in the other, expressly commanded;
and this, not in a case or manner parallel to the variation
between the 16th verse, <i>prohibiting</i> as the general law,
and the passage in Deut. xxv. 5, <i>enjoining</i> in the
exceptional contingency named, but, on the contrary, in a case of
a universal negative met and confronted, two verses afterwards,
by a case of a, not exceptional, contradictory affirmative.&nbsp;
And the only palliation of such a startling discrepancy in Holy
Scripture is, we are to understand, that it is inadmissible to
draw the inference from the woman being forbidden to marry two
brothers, that the man is forbidden to marry two sisters.&nbsp;
Although throughout the restrictions this principle is necessary
to prevent the most revolting permissions under the law, and
although, but for the 18th verse, no one, we believe, would have
dreamed of questioning it in the particular of the man and two
sisters, yet here it must be at once ignored, or you have an
absolute contradiction of commands, in the same enunciation of
law, within two verses. <a name="citation12"></a><a
href="#footnote12" class="citation">[12]</a>&nbsp; I notice this
point expressly, because I think we cannot too strongly entertain
the conviction of the <i>unlikelihood</i> of such a thing
occurring thus in the word and law of God; and therefore, as a
reason for the most careful examination, whether we may not have
overlooked the real scope and object of this 18th verse, even if
we admit the correctness of the translation and of the
sense.&nbsp; Observe, there is a great distinction between the
sense and the application.&nbsp; Admitting the sense, I must deny
the application, as I shall presently shew.&nbsp; But here <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>let me
repeat, if there be but a fairly reasonable account to be given
of the existence and application of the 18th verse, without its
running us into the difficulty of this over-riding, and collision
with itself of God&rsquo;s law, and if we hereby avoid the gross
unlikelihood which I have mentioned, then surely such account and
such application ought to commend itself to every candid mind, as
at least worthy of the most serious consideration.</p>
<p>My Lord, I venture to think such account and application of
the 18th verse there is; and though it has been touched upon by
others, and Dr. M&rsquo;Caul himself came very near it, yet it
appears to have been too little dwelt upon by any, and strangely
overlooked by him. <a name="citation13a"></a><a
href="#footnote13a" class="citation">[13a]</a></p>
<p>Let me here bring the matter once more to the point of
divergence.&nbsp; We have first the general law, &ldquo;None of
you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him&rdquo; (v.
6).&nbsp; We have then the general catalogue of prohibitions
which come under this head, and form the divine comment on the
terms &ldquo;near of kin:&rdquo; and these dealing, with cases of
affinity, in a majority of the prohibitions expressed, as
compared with those of blood relationship (v. 7&ndash;17.)&nbsp;
All these, moreover, be it observed, put in the statement as
commands upon the <i>man</i>, leaving the obligation upon the
<i>woman</i> to be inferred.&nbsp; Upon this statement we have
Archbishop Parker&rsquo;s table of degrees, and of the forbidden
unions, extending exactly to the parallel cases of all those
named;&mdash;with the like witness also of the 99th Canon,
declaring all such alliances to be incestuous;&mdash;and this
table required by our law, both of Church and State, to be set up
in all Parish Churches. <a name="citation13b"></a><a
href="#footnote13b" class="citation">[13b]</a>&nbsp; But we have
then the 18th verse making, as is alleged, not merely an
exception, but a contradiction to the parallel case of what is
forbidden in verse 16 as to the brother&rsquo;s <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>wife, and
permitting the union with a wife&rsquo;s sister, so that it be
not in the lifetime of the former.&nbsp; We thus come to what Dr.
M&rsquo;Caul himself considers to be a case of
<i>over-riding</i>, where we must determine whether (to use again
his own words) &ldquo;the inferential prohibition from verse 16
is to over-ride the expressed command of verse 18, or the plain
letter of this latter verse to over-ride the inference from the
former.&rdquo; <a name="citation14"></a><a href="#footnote14"
class="citation">[14]</a></p>
<p>Now, what I am anxious to see is, whether there is any need to
force upon us this <i>over-riding</i> at all.&nbsp; I think
not.</p>
<p>To show what I mean, I ask this&mdash;Take the prohibition of
the brother&rsquo;s wife first in its plain literal terms, verse
16, and then is there, independently of the 18th verse, any
direct exception to it?&nbsp; Certainly there is.&nbsp; When we
come to the further explication of the Jewish polity, and
God&rsquo;s designs in reference to it, we find a special
provision in the law of the Levirate, (that is, the law of
raising up seed to the deceased brother), which will clash with
that prohibition; for the brother is required to take his
brother&rsquo;s wife and raise up seed to a house in danger of
becoming extinct in Israel.&nbsp; &ldquo;If brethren dwell
together, and one of them die, and have no child, the wife of the
dead shall not marry without unto a stranger: her husband&rsquo;s
brother shall go in unto her, and take her to him to wife, and
perform the duty of an husband&rsquo;s brother unto her.&nbsp;
And it shall be, that the firstborn which she beareth shall
succeed in the name of his brother which is dead, that his name
be not put out of Israel.&nbsp; And if the man like not to take
his brother&rsquo;s wife, then let his brother&rsquo;s wife go up
to the gate unto the elders, and say, My husband&rsquo;s brother
refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name in Israel, he will
not perform the duty of my husband&rsquo;s brother.&nbsp; Then
the elders of his city <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>shall call him, and speak unto him:
and if he stand to it, and say, I like not to take her; then
shall his brother&rsquo;s wife come unto him in the presence of
the elders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in his
face, and say, So shall it be done unto that man that will not
build up his brother&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; And his name shall be
called in Israel, The house of him that hath his shoe
loosed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Deut. xxv., 5&ndash;10.</p>
<p>In this passage there is, not what I should call a
contradiction to the general law, but an exception in a
particular case, and for a particular case only.&nbsp; It is no
general permission over-riding and making of none effect the
general prohibition, but a particular injunction for a special
purpose in one defined contingency.&nbsp; If a man&rsquo;s
brother die childless, his brother shall take his wife and raise
up seed unto his brother.&nbsp; As it was exactly quoted in the
gospel: &ldquo;Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no
children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed
unto his brother.&rdquo; <a name="citation15"></a><a
href="#footnote15" class="citation">[15]</a></p>
<p>We have already observed that the authority of Him who gave
the prohibitory law is sufficient to give also the permissive, or
more than permissive, exception, so that we come into no
difficulty as to the one, in such measure, <i>over-riding</i> (to
use again the term) the other.</p>
<p>But of course the opponent&rsquo;s rejoinder is: Are you not
in the very same case as to the other over-riding?&nbsp; Is not
the authority which gave the prohibition of the 16th verse equal
to give the permission of the 18th?</p>
<p>Granting that it is so, yet I must again call attention to
this; how wholly unlikely it is that, without making any special
exception, for any suggested or defined cause, there should be
within two verses of each other two general laws exactly
contradictory, for so they are, if the argument from parallelism
is allowed.&nbsp; And therefore I must again urge how <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>probable this
makes it, if there be any other reasonable sense or application
of the second passage not involving this contradiction, that such
sense and application should be the true one, and there should be
thus no over-riding at all between those two verses.</p>
<p>Is there then any such reasonable sense and application of the
prohibition of the 18th verse?&nbsp; I think there is.&nbsp; To
see what it is, go back to the exception under the law of the
Levirate, <a name="citation16"></a><a href="#footnote16"
class="citation">[16]</a> and ask whether the application of that
law might not involve a man&rsquo;s marrying two sisters.&nbsp;
Undoubtedly it might.&nbsp; Suppose two brothers to have married
two sisters, and the one brother to die, leaving no child, if, by
the Leviratical law the brother, as he would do under that law
simply, took his brother&rsquo;s widow to raise up seed unto his
brother, he would also be taking to wife his own wife&rsquo;s
sister, and this, it would seem under the injunction in
Deuteronomy, he would not only be permitted but enjoined to
do.&nbsp; But was this to be without exception?&nbsp; I answer,
No!&nbsp; If his own wife, the sister of the other were still
alive, the Almighty did not intend this rule to be carried out in
such case.&nbsp; He, the surviving brother, in that contingency,
should <i>not</i> &ldquo;take a wife to her sister to vex her, .
. . beside the other in her life-time.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
prohibition of the 18th verse of the xviii. chapter of Leviticus
comes in.&nbsp; It comes, in the translation of the authorized
version.&nbsp; It comes, in the sense contended for, as
prohibitory if both sisters are alive together.&nbsp; It comes,
as tacitly sanctioning the union if they are not; but it comes as
limited in its application to this one case and one contemplated
contingency, as God&rsquo;s own exception touching the two
sisters &ldquo;in their life-time:&rdquo;&mdash;His exception, as
to both sisters alive together; the exception to the exception
contained in the <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>law of the Levirate, but as having nothing at all to do
with the general law: as therefore in no way interfering with or
over-riding the general law of the 16th verse; in no way making
its general provision of none effect, as it would do if taken in
the sense and application of these reformers of our marriage
law.&nbsp; And the above-mentioned sense and application which
everyone must allow the 18th verse will bear, nay, which Dr.
M&rsquo;Caul tells us all Jewish authorities claim and sanction,
as at least included in its legislation, is, I must contend,
ample and sufficient to explain the standing of the 18th verse,
and its full meaning, without supposing any other application
whatsoever.</p>
<p>And let it be observed that this statement of such application
to the case of two brothers having married two sisters, and the
consequent duty, in the case of one brother dying childless, of
the other brother to take his widow under the law of Deuteronomy,
modified by the exception of the 18th verse of Lev. xviii, that
such union is not to take place, if his own wife be still alive,
is not mine, but Dr. M&rsquo;Caul&rsquo;s, in a full examination
of certain passages in the Mishna upon this subject.&nbsp; Indeed
it was Dr. M&rsquo;Caul&rsquo;s own statement, in his Letter
addressed, my Lord, to yourself in 1860, which brought to my mind
the main line of argument which I am endeavouring to
unfold.&nbsp; I asked myself;&mdash;If all this in the Mishna and
in Dr. M&rsquo;Caul&rsquo;s explication of the matter, be true,
why is it not the sufficient truth and the whole explanation
needed?&nbsp; Why go on to make a conflict between the two verses
in Leviticus when the 18th verse is acknowledged to be the
enunciation of an exception to the law of the Levirate, and when
this is a full and sufficient account of it?</p>
<p>It will, I think, be no waste of time to extract the passage
to which I refer from Dr. M&rsquo;Caul&rsquo;s letter, as this
will serve both to make what I have here said the more <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>distinct, and
shew also, how entirely both the Mishna and Dr. M&rsquo;Caul
maintain all which I have advanced as to the application of the
verse in Leviticus to the case of the two brothers having married
two sisters, though they refuse (at least the latter) to stop at
this point.</p>
<p>I ought to say thus much as introduction to the Extract.&nbsp;
In his first letter Dr. M&rsquo;Caul had mentioned the Mishna as
confirming his view.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Mishna compiled in the
second century testifies that it (this permission of the
marriage) was the common and received sense of the Hebraizing
Jews.&rdquo; <a name="citation18"></a><a href="#footnote18"
class="citation">[18]</a>&nbsp; This drew some remarks from the
writer of one of the Tracts published by the Marriage Law Defence
Association, (Tract 8, p. 4, and Appendix, quoted also by
yourself in the Appendix to your speech,) upon the statements of
the Mishna, which again caused Dr. M&rsquo;Caul in rejoinder to
examine those statements and to comment upon them afresh in his
letter to yourself.&nbsp; I need not go back to the first two
pamphlets.&nbsp; Dr. M&rsquo;Caul&rsquo;s explanations in his
second letter will shew all which I want to exhibit.&nbsp;
Complaining of inaccurate quotation on the part of the writer of
Tract 8, he says,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I will give the passages as they stand in
the Mishna, and you, Sir, may judge of the faithfulness of this
writer in making quotations.&nbsp; The words of the Mishna
are:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Suppose three brothers, two of them married to
two sisters, and one of them married to a stranger&mdash;one of
the sister&rsquo;s husbands dies, and he who is married to the
stranger takes his widow&mdash;then the wife of the second dies,
and after that he that is married to the stranger dies, behold
this <i>widow</i>, (<i>i.e.</i>, the surviving sister) is
prohibited to him for ever, because she was prohibited to him for
<i>one hour</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Sir, you will perceive several differences between
this statement of the Mishna and that of the Appendix.&nbsp; 1st,
The Appendix says,&mdash;&lsquo;It is declared, that if that <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span><i>brother&rsquo;s wife is his own wife&rsquo;s
sister</i>, <i>he may not marry her</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Mishna
makes no such general statement, but confines itself to a
particular case.&nbsp; 2dly, The reason the Mishna gives for the
prohibition of the surviving sister is that &lsquo;she had been
prohibited to him <i>for one hour</i>,&rsquo; which the Appendix
omits altogether.&nbsp; 3rdly, The Appendix says, &lsquo;And the
reason assigned is, that <i>the man and his wife&rsquo;s
sister</i> are related <i>within the degrees forbidden by the
holy law</i> to intermarry,&rsquo; not one word of which is in
the text of the Mishna, as you see.&nbsp; The Mishna gives the
reason correctly, <i>she had been prohibited to the second
brother for one hour</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, her widowhood commenced
whilst her sister was still alive and the wife of the other
brother, in which case the <i>Rabbis</i> rule that she is
prohibited for ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To make this plain, I will put letters as in the
Appendix:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two brothers | A/B | marry | M/N | Two sisters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A third brother, C, marries S, a stranger, <i>i.e.</i>,
no relation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dies; M is left a widow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;C marries M, A&rsquo;s Widow, to fulfil a
brother-in-law&rsquo;s duty, which B could not do, because to
marry two sisters simultaneously is forbidden by Lev. xviii.
18.&nbsp; This is the &lsquo;one hour&rsquo; during which M is
prohibited to B.</p>
<p>&ldquo;N then dies, and B is left a widower; but he is not
allowed to marry M, left a second time a widow, because on the
death of A, whilst N, his wife, was alive, M was
prohibited.&nbsp; Out of this particular case, by putting in
words not in the Mishna, and by leaving out the words &lsquo;one
hour,&rsquo; which are in the Mishna, the writer has made a new
Rabbinic law, unknown to the Mishna and its commentators, and
from a particular case has drawn a general conclusion, opposed to
Jewish law and practice.&nbsp; For, take the <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>deaths in a
different order, so as to avoid the &lsquo;one hour,&rsquo; and
then B might marry M.&nbsp; Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two brothers | A/B | marry | M/N | Two sisters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A third brother, C, marries S, a stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose that N dies first, and after she is dead A dies
without children, then B may marry M, because she had not been
&lsquo;prohibited to him for <i>one hour</i>,&rsquo; <i>i.e.</i>,
she had not been a widow whilst his own wife was alive.&nbsp; The
second case alluded to is exactly similar:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mishna III. 9.&mdash;&lsquo;Suppose two brothers [A and
B] married two sisters [M and N].&nbsp; If one of the brothers
[A] die, and afterwards the wife of the second [N] die, then the
widow [M] is prohibited to the surviving brother [B] because she
had been prohibited to him <i>one hour</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose that N had died first, and then A died
without children, then it would have been lawful for B to marry
M, as may be seen in Maimonides, Yad Hachazakah, Hilchoth Yibbum,
ch. vii., &sect; 3, 4, where there is an analogous case.&nbsp;
The prohibition in the one case, and the permission in the other,
depends, not upon the words of the law, but upon a general rule
<i>laid down by the Rabbis</i>; that the lawfulness or
unlawfulness, as well as the obligation to perform the duty of a
brother-in-law, is regulated by the state of things existing at
the moment when the brother died.&rdquo; <a
name="citation20"></a><a href="#footnote20"
class="citation">[20]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have extracted the above at full length, because at the same
time that it shews all I want and even more than I want for my
purpose, it yet also shews no contradiction to what I want,
whilst it shews also that I suppress no part of Dr.
M&rsquo;Caul&rsquo;s statement or argument.&nbsp; I say that it
shews something more than I want, though nothing contradictory to
it; because I have no need to consider either the third case of a
brother marrying a stranger, <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>or the case of the <i>one hour</i>
commented upon by the Mishna, or at least this case no further
than as it brings out into the plainest prominence Dr.
M&rsquo;Caul&rsquo;s own witness to the sense of Lev. xviii. 18,
that it forbids &ldquo;B to marry A&rsquo;s widow, because <i>to
marry two sisters simultaneously is forbidden by Lev. xviii.</i>
18.&rdquo;&nbsp; That is, by the law of the Levirate simply, this
would have been required, but by the exception of the above verse
it is forbidden. <a name="citation21"></a><a href="#footnote21"
class="citation">[21]</a></p>
<p>And this is what I mean by saying the passage shews all I
want.&nbsp; It proves incontestably that according to the Mishna,
according to the Jewish Rabbis, according to Dr. M&rsquo;Caul,
the enactment of the 18th verse of the xviii. of Leviticus was
inserted, for the very purpose which I have all along
supposed:&mdash;that it was the declaration of God&rsquo;s will,
that when the operation of the law of the Levirate <i>per se</i>
would bring about the brother taking his own wife&rsquo;s sister
to wife to raise up seed unto his brother, <i>then</i> the
exception to the exception came in and forbade him to do so, if
her sister, his own wife, were alive.&nbsp; And this is what made
me say (p. 13) that Dr. M&rsquo;Caul came very near to the
application of that text which I have been unfolding, though I
was obliged to add, he overlooked its importance in interpreting
the law as contained in Leviticus, for he allows that the 18th
verse of Leviticus xviii. reaches to, is intended to reach to,
and to forbid, this especial union, which otherwise would have
been enjoined by the law in Deut. xxv., but it appears never to
have occurred to him that this is the ample and sufficient
explanation of the existence of that 18th verse.&nbsp; He never
seems to have conceived it possible that it should be restricted
to being the exception to the Leviratical Law, and not be a
general Law itself.</p>
<p>I would, my Lord, for many reasons, had it so pleased God,
that Dr. M&rsquo;Caul were alive.&nbsp; His ability and learning,
his strong sense and true piety, and not least his willing
readiness to <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>join with those who might differ from him in many points
in the defence of our common Church and common faith against the
assaults of infidelity and rationalism, make his death a no
ordinary loss to us in days like these.&nbsp; But beyond this, I
own, had it so been possible, I should have liked to point out to
him how his own statements, his own authorities, and his own
reasoning had been the very means to lead me to the conclusion,
that we find a very complete and sufficient explanation of the
existence and meaning of the 18th verse of Lev. xviii., without
any occasion to resort to so violent an over-riding one statement
of Scripture by another, as he has advocated.&nbsp; And this too
without having to question the ordinary translation of the verse,
or to find any difficulty in the sense of the words, &ldquo;in
her lifetime.&rdquo;&nbsp; All this, at any rate for the sake of
argument, I seem able to concede to Dr. M&rsquo;Caul, to take his
own account of <i>an</i> application of the passage, and only
add, that it seems to me to be <i>the</i> application, and the
only application needed.&nbsp; I cannot forbear adding, that if
there be but a chance of this being so, it makes it a most
serious thing for anyone to speak lightly of the restrictions in
question&mdash;not merely of this one of the brother&rsquo;s
wife, but of all those laid down in this chapter of Leviticus, or
to <i>think</i> even of relaxing that code; for who shall say
that we shall not thus &ldquo;haply be found to fight against
God,&rdquo; and be bringing ourselves and our country under the
curse of His Word, denounced against all who defile themselves in
these things: &ldquo;Ye shall therefore keep My statutes and My
judgments; and shall not commit any of these abominations,
neither any of your own nation, nor any stranger that sojourneth
among you: (for all these abominations have the men of the land
done which were before you, and the land is defiled:) that the
land spue not you out also, as it spued out the nations that were
before you.&nbsp; For whosoever shall commit any of these <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>abominations,
even the souls that commit them shall be cut off from among their
people.&nbsp; Therefore shall ye keep Mine ordinance, that ye
commit not any of these abominable customs which were committed
before you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I am the
Lord.&rdquo; <a name="citation23"></a><a href="#footnote23"
class="citation">[23]</a>&nbsp; In these days, my lord, we have
many things to make us anxious&mdash;many things, I do not go too
far in saying, to make us tremble; but I hardly know anything
which should fill us more with anxiety, fear and trembling, than
the thought that our legislature should bring us under this
terrible curse of God, by sanctioning, as the act of a people
among whom &ldquo;Christianity is&rdquo; still &ldquo;the law of
the land,&rdquo; any one of those abominations, for which even
the nations of Canaan were cut off and spued out.&nbsp; And as to
individuals, I must say, there are to me few things more
calculated to raise mixed feelings of pity, contempt and horror,
than the levity and recklessness of some of those who are
advocating the change&mdash;pity for the ignorance of many who
have been misled by mere bold assertion, contempt for the
reasoning powers of others who seem never to dream of looking at
any side of the question except that on which their own passions,
prejudices, or wishes are enlisted, and horror at the fearful
temerity of those who dare approach and argue upon such a
subject, without at least a sense of its importance, of the
reverence with which all discussion relative to it should be
conducted, and an awe, at any rate, as to the possibility, after
all, of God&rsquo;s law and will being in accordance with the
Church&rsquo;s interpretation of it for so long a time, and
wholly against the &ldquo;new thing&rdquo; which the spirit of
modern lawlessness seems anxious to introduce!</p>
<p>My Lord, I have not designed or attempted to go through the
whole argument on the question of the alteration of <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>the Marriage
law as now proposed, but have sought to confine myself to these
points:</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; That the whole strength of the case of the promoters
of the change, so far as Holy Scripture is concerned, rests upon
the text, Lev. xviii. 18, this text being taken to override the
prohibition of Lev. xviii. 16.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; That the contradiction of two general laws in
God&rsquo;s Word, the one to the other, in the course of three
verses is highly unlikely and improbable; so improbable that we
are justified in expecting to find some other solution of the
difficulty.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; That in the case in hand, there is another solution
falling very naturally into its place by careful comparison of
Scripture with Scripture.</p>
<p>To sum up the general argument, even at the risk of some
repetition, we may state it thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>(i.)&nbsp; We have the general rule laid down: &ldquo;None of
you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him&rdquo;
(verse 6).</p>
<p>(ii.)&nbsp; We have the instances and exemplifications of what
this &ldquo;nearness of kin&rdquo; means, all of these given
directly with reference to the <i>man</i>, leaving the
corresponding <i>woman&rsquo;s</i> duty to be inferred (verses
7&ndash;17).</p>
<p>(iii.)&nbsp; We have the particular case of the
brother&rsquo;s wife (verse 16); whereupon, by parity of
reasoning, is inferred the prohibition of the wife&rsquo;s
sister, it being here to be observed, that unless the cases of
the different sex, by parity of reason, be taken as contemplated
by the Holy Ghost in giving this Scripture, we have no written
law against several most frightful kinds of incest. <a
name="citation24"></a><a href="#footnote24"
class="citation">[24]</a></p>
<p>(iv.)&nbsp; We have an exception to the very letter of the law
as to the brother&rsquo;s wife, by the injunction of the law of
the Levirate, in the provision for preventing the extinction of a
house in Israel, by the brother&rsquo;s taking his deceased
brother&rsquo;s <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>wife (if he have died childless), and raising up seed
unto his brother: this, not in the nature of a prohibition, but
of an exceptional injunction or command. (Deut. xxv.
5&ndash;10.)</p>
<p>(v.)&nbsp; We have an exception to the above exception,
forbidding its being extended to the taking the wife&rsquo;s
sister in the case of the above injunction working (as in one
special case it might work), to the result of a brother, in
taking his deceased brother&rsquo;s widow, taking also, by the
same act, his own wife&rsquo;s sister, and thus, if his own wife
were still alive, having the two sisters together as wives.&nbsp;
For this would be the case, were there no exceptional
prohibition, when two brothers had married two sisters, and when,
though one of the brothers had died childless, yet both sisters
were alive.&nbsp; Then there comes in the exception:
&ldquo;Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex her .
. . beside the other in her lifetime&rdquo; (verse 18); as if it
were said, In no case&mdash;no, not when the law of the Levirate
would otherwise require it&mdash;no, not when the saving of a
house in Israel from extinction would otherwise demand
it&mdash;shall a man take his wife&rsquo;s sister, his own wife,
her sister, being yet alive: where, too, we may observe, that the
parallelism in the cases of the two brothers and the two sisters
is strictly and exactly maintained; for the woman in no case
<i>could</i> take a second brother, the other being alive; for
her husband, the first brother, <i>must be dead</i> before the
law of the Levirate could operate at all; therefore the
wife&rsquo;s sister <i>could not</i> (even when two brothers had
married two sisters) take her husband&rsquo;s brother beside the
other in his lifetime, and thus the wife&rsquo;s sister is
exactly equally restrained from taking the sister&rsquo;s
husband, when the circumstances would lead to it by a man taking
&ldquo;a wife to her sister . . . beside the other in her
lifetime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus, too, it is clear that the law of this 18th verse is a
law of prohibition, not of relaxation, and therefore naturally <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>and properly
comes in its place with the other prohibitions of this 18th
chapter of Leviticus.</p>
<p>And I venture to submit, that this is the whole meaning and
application of this much controverted verse: viz., that it is not
in the nature of a general law at all, but is merely the
declaration of an exception to an exception&mdash;an exception to
preclude two living sisters being simultaneously the wives of one
man, even when the law of the Levirate, but for this prohibition,
would lead to such result.&nbsp; I must add, that to me it seems
to be a full, natural and sufficient explanation of the passage
without any further application at all, that is, without
supposing it to have anything to do with the general law, or to
be any relaxation of the prohibition of the 16th verse as to the
brother&rsquo;s wife, or the converse case to it, by analogy, as
to the wife&rsquo;s sister.</p>
<p>Possibly the exact bearing of the foregoing argument may be
made plainer by a paraphrase of the Scriptural statements,
putting them something into the form of statute law, by which
means the different provisions of the several passages may be
combined and their connection be seen, as various provisions in
the clauses or sections of an Act of Parliament are read
together.&nbsp; I dare say I shall expose myself to not unjust
criticism for technical blunders, in attempting to adopt
Act-of-Parliament phraseology; but I shall be content to bear
this, if I may attain my main object, viz., to shew how the
different parts of the law combine and should be read in
connection with each other, and especially what is the force and
due application of what will be, so to speak, the last clause or
section in the Act.</p>
<p>Suppose, then, God&rsquo;s law as to these marriages to stand
in the statute-book of a Jewish Parliament, imagining for the
moment such to have existed.&nbsp; Might not the principal
enactments stand something in this way?&nbsp; It will be
understood <a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>that a permission or tacit sanction of polygamy must be
assumed, as part of the common law of the community.&nbsp; Say,
then, that the enactments in question stood thus:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">[None to intermarry with those near
of kin.]</p>
<p>&sect; 1.&nbsp; Be it enacted, that none shall inter-marry
with any related to them, whether by blood relationship or by
affinity, within the following degrees, as set forth in the
annexed schedule:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">[Schedule of Prohibited
Degrees.]</p>
<p>(Then suppose Archbishop Parker&rsquo;s Table of Prohibited
Degrees here annexed as the schedule.)</p>
<p>The Act would then continue:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">[Brother to marry deceased
Brother&rsquo;s Wife, to raise up seed to his Brother.]</p>
<p>&sect; 2.&nbsp; Provided always, that, in reference to the
above prohibition of the brother taking his brother&rsquo;s
widow, it shall yet be lawful, authorized and required (under
penalty of a stigma of disgrace, to be attached to him who fails
in compliance), that in the case of a man&rsquo;s brother dying
childless, in order to prevent the extinction of a house in
Israel, his brother shall take the deceased brother&rsquo;s wife,
and raise up seed unto his brother; and, therefore, that the
first-born child of such union shall succeed in the name of the
brother who is dead, and be accounted and taken by the law of
this land as not of the family of the second brother, but of the
first, and shall be the heir, both in name and possessions, of
that deceased brother, whose widow&rsquo;s child he is.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">[But none to take a wife to her
sister, beside the other in her life-time.]</p>
<p>&sect; 3.&nbsp; But, inasmuch as in the case of two brothers
having married two sisters, the enactment of the preceding
section might, and, in the event of one brother dying childless,
would, authorize and require a man to take to wife two sisters,
his brother&rsquo;s widow being in such case his own wife&rsquo;s
sister, and whereas, if his own wife should at such time be
alive, this might lead to rivalry and vexation, be it further
enacted, that nothing herein enacted, in the previous section <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>or in any
part of this Act, shall authorize, permit or require any brother,
even for the purpose of saving a house and family from
extinction, to take to wife the sister of his own wife, his said
wife her sister being yet alive; and be it therefore enacted,
that in such case, where such would be the result of the
enactment of the previous section of this Act the provision of
the said previous section shall become inoperative and of none
effect, rather than a man take a wife to her sister to vex her,
beside the other, in her lifetime.</p>
<p>Upon this illustration I will only ask&mdash;Would not such an
Act of Parliament be perfectly distinct and clear?&nbsp; Could
any one possibly misunderstand it?&nbsp; Would not every clause
and section have its own plain and intelligible sense?&nbsp;
Especially would not the last clause or section have a full and
sufficient both sense and application without any man&rsquo;s
dreaming for a single moment of there being contained in it a
repeal of any portion of the table or schedule of degrees?&nbsp;
I say contained <i>in it</i>, because no doubt the second section
would contain something of this kind, and yet, be it observed,
not a repeal, but a partial exception; that is, in one particular
case, and for one particular specified purpose, the second
section would modify one entry in the table, that of the
brother&rsquo;s wife or sister&rsquo;s husband (as it is
confessed on all hands, the law of the Levirate, Deut. xxv., does
modify the law of the 16th verse of Lev. xviii.), but even so, I
must insist upon it, not <i>repealing</i> it; for the exception
would operate <i>only</i> when the brother had died childless,
leaving the entry in the schedule in fulness of prohibition in
all other cases.&nbsp; And it is beyond all question that that
modification would be due to the second and not to the third
section of the Act.&nbsp; The third or last section would have
nothing to do with any relaxation of the law, but would be merely
a restrictive provision in relation to the working of the
previous section, being, as I have all along been shewing, <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>a narrowing,
not an enlarging the liberty given under the exception in the
previous clause and having no further bearing:&mdash;therefore
having nothing to do with any entry in the schedule; nothing to
do with the permission to take the brother&rsquo;s wife or the
sister&rsquo;s husband, and, if so, nothing at all to do with the
object for which that clause, so to speak, is used by the
promoters of the change in our law, as proposed in the
Wife&rsquo;s Sister&rsquo;s Marriage Bill.</p>
<p>Moreover, does not this account make it perfectly intelligible
why the first section should remain in the integrity of its
enactment, and all the entries find their place in the schedule,
because no single entry is repealed even by the modification
caused by section 2?&nbsp; But surely it would have been absurd
to enact, or to retain in the table, the entry as to a
brother&rsquo;s wife or sister&rsquo;s husband, if an almost
immediately subsequent contradictory enactment were wholly to
repeal it, as contended by the promoters of the Bill in
question.</p>
<p>I do not know that I have more to add unless it be to meet
briefly a possible objection from the law of the Levirate not
being found in the same place with the other two passages, nor
indeed in the same book of Leviticus, but in another book of Holy
Scripture.&nbsp; It may, perhaps, be asked&mdash;Is it not
strange and unnatural to find the exception to an exception
entered where the first exception itself is not recorded, and
perhaps even before that exception was made at all?</p>
<p>I would reply, first&mdash;</p>
<p>If this be an objection, it is one to which the Mishna, and
the Jewish Rabbis, and Dr. M&rsquo;Caul are open just as much as
I am.&nbsp; For they all acknowledge and maintain that upon that
18th verse of xviii. Leviticus is founded the prohibition which
they all claim as to the brother in the case of two brothers
having married two sisters; of the one <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>not being permitted to obey the
injunction of the law of the Levirate, as to taking the
other&rsquo;s wife in the particular case of the one brother
leaving a widow whilst the other brother&rsquo;s wife is yet
living.</p>
<p>I would reply, secondly&mdash;</p>
<p>That the objection, from the exception in Deut. xxv. not
possibly having been then made, is as nothing when the lawgiver
is not man but God, who knows from the beginning all which He
intends. <a name="citation30"></a><a href="#footnote30"
class="citation">[30]</a></p>
<p>I would reply, thirdly&mdash;</p>
<p>That a fair and reasonable account of the statements in
Leviticus xviii. not alluding directly to the law of Deut. xxv.,
and not in any way indicating the exception there made or to be
made to the prohibition of verse 16, is to be found in this: that
all the statements in that chapter of Leviticus are
<i>prohibitions</i>, whilst the record in Deuteronomy is a
<i>permission</i> or indeed a <i>command</i>; that, therefore, it
is perfectly reasonable and natural that we should not find
prohibitions and relaxations of the law mixed up together.&nbsp;
Thus Leviticus keeps to its prohibitions, verse after verse, with
the warnings and denunciation of penalties proper to its subject;
and Deuteronomy deals with its exceptional relaxation, and the
duties and consequences therewith connected.&nbsp; And it may be
just worth while to add that although the 18th verse of Leviticus
xviii. is an exception, it is still in the sense and application
which I have been enforcing, a prohibitory not a permissive
exception; a consideration which not only shows it is in its due
place among the other prohibitions, but also strengthens the view
taken in this letter of its being no more than a
prohibition.&nbsp; It <i>prohibits</i> the taking two sisters
simultaneously, even under circumstances which, but for its
existence, would have <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>required such union, and it does not
permit anything as against the laws of the 6th and 16th
verses.&nbsp; Were Dr. M&rsquo;Caul&rsquo;s view, and the view of
the promoters of the alteration of our law of marriage correct,
we should at least have the anomaly of a permissive precept
foisted in, if I may so say, among the prohibitory sentences of
this chapter, dealing in all else with prohibitions only.&nbsp;
For, it is plain, to read the verse as meaning a man may marry
two sisters, if it be not simultaneously, is a permission upon
the previous restriction; whilst to say a man may <i>not</i>
marry two sisters simultaneously, even when the law of the
Levirate would seem to demand it, is a prohibition.&nbsp; The law
of Deuteronomy, therefore, (the law of the Levirate,) being a
permission or command, not a prohibition, makes it no marvel that
that injunction is not found among the prohibitions, whilst that
the prohibitional exceptional decree of the 18th verse of Lev.
xviii., should be found where it is, among the prohibitions, is
no marvel either.</p>
<p>I would reply, fourthly&mdash;</p>
<p>That to find the law of the Levirate in this place in the Book
of Leviticus would have been to find a provision solely and
simply of the Jewish economy and polity, most unnaturally
intermixed with the provisions of God&rsquo;s general moral
law:&mdash;that is, what is applicable solely to Moses and the
people under him, confused with the law intended for all nations
and people, as witnessed by the denunciations of that chapter of
the book of Leviticus with which we have been concerned.&nbsp;
How is it possible to suppose the Leviratical injunction of
Deuteronomy could have found a place among the things prohibited
and condemned as the abominations of the Canaanites and
Egyptians?</p>
<p>I would reply, fifthly&mdash;</p>
<p>That if any further answer to the above objection be <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>needed, there
is, at least, the general and most sufficient reply, that we are
no judges of the right collocation of different points in
God&rsquo;s revelation to man.&nbsp; When we see the fitness of
anything, even as we can judge, we may glorify Him and be
thankful; when we cannot, we may and should &ldquo;put our mouth
in the dust&rdquo; and be humble.&nbsp; If things are not made
more plain to us than they are, or even are less plain than they
might have been, let us remember our state of trial, and
acknowledge that all such may be, for ought we know, exactly so
revealed as they are, and so placed as they are, for our
trial.&nbsp; There is no reason why we should not be tried just
as much as to difficulties put before our intellect, as by
temptations appealing to our passions; and, as Bishop Butler has
remarked, there are some men who, but for the former, might be
found to have hardly any trial at all.&nbsp; (Analogy, Part ii.,
chapter 6.)&nbsp; If the particular objection here advanced be
analyzed, it will be found to be but this:&mdash;Why should there
have been <i>an omission</i> of this law of the Levirate in
Leviticus, when, in the same place, there is the record of a
prohibitory exception to it?&nbsp; But who shall pretend to
account for the omissions of Holy Scripture?&nbsp; Take but that
one record in St. Luke&rsquo;s Gospel of the two disciples who,
on the morning of the Resurrection, walked to Emmaus, and were
met by Jesus on the way, as they talked of those things which had
come to pass, and were sad.&nbsp; What can be more wonderful to
our conception than what we find, and what we do not find!&nbsp;
After their converse concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a
Prophet mighty in word and deed before God and all the people, we
find that He himself, &ldquo;beginning at Moses and all the
Prophets, expounded unto them in all the Scriptures the things
concerning Himself.&rdquo; <a name="citation32"></a><a
href="#footnote32" class="citation">[32]</a>&nbsp; But we <i>do
not find</i> a single syllable of all this discourse recorded in
the Gospel.&nbsp; <a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>If we judged by what seemed to us likely, how sure
should we feel that it would have been set down!&nbsp; Oh! how
many difficulties might have been met! how many objections have
been answered! how many heresies have been avoided! how great a
flood of light have been thrown upon various points of history,
prophecy, and doctrine! and how great a guide have been given for
all in life and conduct! had it seemed good to the Holy Ghost to
let the Evangelist record that discourse.&nbsp; If we judged by
our sense of likelihood, should we not say, &ldquo;What could be
so full of interest and of edification!&nbsp; How important! how
needful for us to know what our Lord said, when beginning at
Moses and all the Prophets, He expounded unto them in all the
Scriptures the things concerning Himself!&rdquo;&nbsp; But not
one word of it is set down, and, perchance, for the very cause
that it would have too much abridged our trial had we possessed
such an exposition, and that we may learn in all things not to
judge amiss as to the hard things or the secret things in
God&rsquo;s Word nor to think &ldquo;His ways are as our
ways.&rdquo;&nbsp; Had that discourse been placed before us,
perchance there had never been an Arian or a Socinian in the
world.&nbsp; (How good we might think it!)&nbsp; Had the whole
marriage law of God, if we may so say, been systematically set
down in His holy Word, it may be there would have been none now
to tamper with it.&nbsp; (How happy, too, we should think
it!)&nbsp; But we might as well say, &ldquo;How happy if Adam had
had no trial put upon him, and so had never fallen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But our duty is, as it is, and as God has thought fit to set
it before us.&nbsp; He has revealed to us His law and will in
such manner and degree as seemed to Him good.&nbsp; It is
our&rsquo;s to receive it and to seek to understand it as most
humbly and reverently we may, and, asking His grace and help, to
do our best to keep it: to keep it individually in our own lives,
<a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>and so far
as He permits us, to keep it from all defilement or breach in the
laws of our country.&nbsp; We call ourselves, and rightly, a
Christian country, for we are, as baptized into the body of
Christ, His members.&nbsp; Let us remember, if even carelessly,
much more if wilfully, we go against His commands, and set human
law in its permission against the divine law in its prohibition,
we are rebellious against Him who is our God and our King; we are
going back from our Christian state and profession; we are
placing ourselves on the level of the nations&mdash;the Egyptians
and the Canaanites&mdash;who committed all those abominations,
against which His curse is denounced who is &ldquo;the same
yesterday and today, and for ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Buckingham Road</i>, <i>Brighton</i>, <i>July</i>

<p>P.S.&mdash;Whilst these sheets are passing through the press,
I am reminded of an objection taken to the whole line of the
argument of my letter upon the very strength of the law of the
Levirate.&nbsp; I am told (and I think the view was touched upon
in the report of the Commission) that there are some who deem the
law of the Levirate to be the total repeal of the prohibition as
to the brother&rsquo;s wife (which most certainly it is not), and
who would then go on to say, And, upon your own shewing, after
the wife&rsquo;s death this very law of the Levirate will bring
you to the conclusion of marrying the wife&rsquo;s sister.</p>
<p>I should, perhaps, hardly deem it necessary to notice
seriously such an objection, but that I hear of it as actually
made or revived at the present time.&nbsp; I will then say a few
words upon it.&nbsp; I reply; Consider what must be assumed, <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>and what must
be denied, to bring this argument in any way to bear upon the
question before the Legislature.</p>
<p>First&mdash;It must be assumed that the law of the Levirate is
a law binding upon Christians; that it is a law, not simply
intended for the Jewish economy, but that a Christian man is
intended to take his brother&rsquo;s widow, if he have died
childless, and raise up seed unto his brother.</p>
<p>Secondly&mdash;It must be assumed that this object is to be
attained, not by the taking the brother&rsquo;s widow, but by
taking the wife&rsquo;s sister, which is the object of the Bill,
but was not the object at all of the Jewish legislation, and
which, moreover, is absolutely absurd as to the end of raising up
seed unto a brother.</p>
<p>Thirdly&mdash;It must be denied that polygamy is forbidden to
Christians; for if the brother in the case supposed have a wife
previously to his brother&rsquo;s death, (this wife being still
alive, but not the sister of his deceased brother&rsquo;s wife,)
then, according to the law of the Levirate hereby assumed to be
in force, he must still take his brother&rsquo;s widow to wife to
raise up seed unto his brother.</p>
<p>Or, Fourthly, if the argument be not carried quite so far, and
it be maintained that the brother should say, &ldquo;I cannot
take her, lest I mar my own inheritance;&rdquo; or, &ldquo;I
cannot take her, as I have already a wife;&rdquo; or, &ldquo;I
like not to take her for I am engaged to another;&rdquo; or, if
he should for any cause refuse, then, at least, if the law of the
Levirate be binding upon us (which is the argument; for if not,
it does not help the promoters of the Bill at all), the refuser
should undergo the penalty provided in the case, and we should
have to witness the scene of the widow, or the wife&rsquo;s
sister, calling together the elders of her city, and loosing the
shoe of her husband&rsquo;s brother, or sister&rsquo;s husband,
and spitting in his face and saying, &ldquo;So shall it be clone
unto that man that will not to build up his brother&rsquo;s
house;&rdquo; and we should <a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>have to revive the name of &ldquo;the
house of him that hath his shoe loosed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No!&nbsp; Who does not see that the whole scope and intention
of the law of the Levirate was Judaical, and limited to and
exhausted by that economy.&nbsp; And, therefore, if the
connection between the law of the Levirate and the 18th verse of
Lev. xviii. be established, as I have endeavoured to shew it is,
it will follow that the exception to that law <i>must</i> belong
exclusively to it and expire with it; and, therefore, that the
supposed permission to take the sister, &ldquo;beside the
other,&rdquo; if it be not &ldquo;in her life-time,&rdquo; has,
as I have all along been arguing, nothing to do with us as
Christians at all, but is tied to and restrained by the law of
the Levirate, and of the Jewish dispensation.&nbsp; Under it, it
was lawful, it was enjoined, when a brother died childless, for
the brother to take his wife and raise up seed unto his brother;
and this would be lawful and enjoined in that particular case
even when his brother&rsquo;s widow was his own wife&rsquo;s
sister, if his own wife, the sister of the other were dead.&nbsp;
But among Christians I cannot believe that any one seriously
believes for a moment that the law of the Levirate remains, and
so no one can suppose, if the 18th verse of Lev. xviii. be merely
the exception to that law, that it has any bearing upon, or gives
any permission to, Christians in their marriages at all. <a

<h2><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>APPENDIX A.</h2>
<p>The only two passages which I have met with taking the same
line of argument with that of the foregoing letter are the
following.&nbsp; In an appendix to the Speech of Vice-Chancellor
Sir W. Page Wood, Feb. 1st, 1860, I find this comment upon the
statements in the Mishna:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The passages from the <i>Mishna</i> afford
singular support to the view which the Bishop of Oxford, at the
late meeting, stated to be held by some divines in America, viz.,
that the difficult 18th verse of the 18th chapter of Leviticus
was, in fact, a special prohibition against a wife&rsquo;s sister
being married to her brother-in-law, even when the exceptional
<i>Levirical</i> law (or law by which the brother-in-law was to
raise up seed to his deceased brother) might otherwise have
appeared to supersede the general code of the 18th
chapter.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In an article recently reprinted from the Church Review, of
February, 1861, understood to be from the pen of the Rev. T. W.
Perry, I find also this:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;May it not be, then, that the prohibition
simply related to the (apparently) Patriarchal requirement (see
Gen. xxxviii. 8), enforced in Deut. xxv. 5&ndash;10 (that is,
<i>after</i> the Levitical prohibitions were given), which
commanded the <i>next kinsman</i> to marry the widow of one who
died without issue, in order to preserve the inheritance?&nbsp;
For if the next kinsman was a brother of the deceased, the duty
of raising up seed to his brother first devolved upon him.&nbsp;
But he might refuse to perform it.&nbsp; In that instance he
underwent a kind of punishment.&nbsp; The widow loosed his shoe
and spat in his face before the elders of his city (Deut. xxv. 8
and 9), and he became stigmatized as &lsquo;the house of him that
hath his shoe loosed&rsquo; (v. 10).&nbsp; This liberty to refuse
(see also Ruth iii. 12 and iv. 6) may have been a Divine
relaxation of the Patriarchal rule, designed, perhaps, to render
more effectual the prohibition in Lev. xviii. 18.&nbsp; But it
may not improbably be, that the penalty attached was meant to
secure the custom from contempt, by deterring the kinsman from
excusing himself on grounds which the law of the Levirate
(<i>i.e.</i>, the law of raising up seed to the deceased brother)
did not mean to recognize.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, after some remarks upon the jealousy or vexation likely
to arise, the writer continues:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;May it not, therefore, have been that God
designed, in Lev. xviii. 18, to provide against this evil, which
was very likely to attend upon the performance of the existing
rule, and of his own command (then to be given) touching the
marriage of the deceased brother&rsquo;s wife?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet, how does this explanation meet the difficulty
arising from the alleged permission contained in the words (v.
18) &lsquo;in her life-time?&rsquo;&nbsp; Thus&mdash;If the next
kinsman&rsquo;s wife were already dead, or if she died before the
kinsman&rsquo;s part had been done to the widow, or after that
part had been done by another kinsman, who had died leaving the
widow still childless then, as she <i>could not be vexed</i>, the
widow&rsquo;s brother-in-law was free to marry her, for the
purpose specified in the Levirate law.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And again:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Since this first suggested itself to us, we
have learnt (see Tract x. p. 21, of the Marriage Law Association)
that the <i>Mishna</i>, treating of the civil law <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>of the Jews
as to marrying the deceased brother&rsquo;s wife, says that he
may not marry her <i>if she is his own wife&rsquo;s sister</i>,
and, moreover, that the prohibition holds good <i>after</i> the
wife&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; It is possible that this latter part of
the tradition may be akin to what our Lord called (S. Mark vii.
9) &lsquo;your own tradition,&rsquo; and so may have tended to
&lsquo;frustrate the commandment of God,&rsquo; in Lev. xviii.
18, by perplexing the interpretation of the words, &lsquo;in her
life-time.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I may add, however, as shewing my argument to be an
independent witness to the same sense and application of
Leviticus xviii. 18, that I had no knowledge of either of these
statements when I sketched out the argument of the preceding
letter.</p>
<h2>APPENDIX B.</h2>
<p>I have said that I have no need to enter into the question of
the &ldquo;one hour&rdquo; mentioned in the Mishna.&nbsp; And
this is certainly true, because the question which I have been
considering is not whether, if a wife&rsquo;s sister be forbidden
at all she is forbidden for ever by both being alive together at
a certain time but simply whether the whole matter involved in
the words &ldquo;in her life-time&rdquo; be not explained and
accounted for by its being a prohibition, narrowing the
requirements of the law of the Levirate, and nothing more.&nbsp;
But it may be added that the statement of the Mishna as to the
&ldquo;one hour&rdquo; is certainly rather confirmatory than not
of the second sister being wholly forbidden, except under that
law&rsquo;s provision in the case of the death of the one
previous to the widowhood of the other, because if the being
forbidden for one hour forbids for ever, the second sister,
whether herself a virgin or the widow of a stranger, being (like
the brother&rsquo;s widow left a widow in her sister&rsquo;s
life-time) marriageable to any other man than her brother-in-law,
during all the time of her sister&rsquo;s married life, (she, I
say,) would be all that time forbidden to him.&nbsp; This would
answer certainly to the one hour, and if so, under the Rule of
the Mishna, she would be forbidden to him for ever, which brings
us to the general prohibition under the general law.</p>
<p>Whether the above inference of the Mishna be a legitimate one
from the words &ldquo;in her life-time,&rdquo; that is, that the
forbidding should depend for ever upon the state of things at the
time of the brother&rsquo;s death (as Dr. M&rsquo;Caul expresses
it), I need not determine.&nbsp; Mr. Perry, in one of the
extracts above, seems to think it might rather be one of the
additions by which the Jews frustrated &ldquo;the Word of God by
their tradition,&rdquo; and possibly it was so.&nbsp; But at
least we may say that there appears to be a weighty moral
consideration to support the view of the prohibition extending
from one hour to the future life.&nbsp; Because thus, in the case
of a man finding his brother&rsquo;s wife a widow, being his own
wife&rsquo;s sister, and perchance preferring her to his own
wife, he might otherwise be tempted to get rid of his own wife,
<a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>by divorce
(so easily obtainable as divorce became among the Jews) or
otherwise, if such after-release set him at liberty to marry his
brother&rsquo;s wife, being a widow: a temptation be it observed
not occurring as to any other woman left a widow by his
brother&rsquo;s death, because the tacit sanction given to
polygamy under the Jewish dispensation would in that case render
it unnecessary to obtain release from his own wife at all in
order to take her.&nbsp; If the brother had died childless, he
would be enjoined to take her, irrespectively of his own wife
being alive.&nbsp; If not childless, he could never take her at
all.&nbsp; And this moral reason is not perhaps wholly unworthy
of consideration as applying to the general question of marriage
with a wife&rsquo;s sister in a state of things in which polygamy
is forbidden.&nbsp; If the greater intimacy arising between a man
and his wife&rsquo;s sister might, if unrestrained by the
knowledge that she can never under any circumstances become his
wife, tend to produce attachment, who shall say it is not a
merciful and a wholesome restraint, that she should be forbidden
to him for ever?&nbsp; And this restraint, be it remarked, would
be wholly lost under the change in our law now sought.</p>
<h2>APPENDIX C.</h2>
<p>The drift of the objection considered in the Postscript may
receive an illustration from that great moral drama, in the plot
and conduct of which horror at the incestuous connection of the
king with his brother&rsquo;s widow bears so prominent a
part.&nbsp; The case of the objector who would make the law of
the Levirate a dispensation for Christians, is just as if
Claudius king of Denmark had pleaded that law, though his brother
had not died childless (for no modern legislation proposes to
regard this limitation), as a reason for taking to wife his
brother&rsquo;s widow;&mdash;or, as if, yet further, had Queen
Gertrude died, leaving a sister, he should plead again that same
law (for all modern legislation proposes to go to this extent),
to sanction his afterward taking her also to wife.&nbsp; Surely
all this, as the king says of another matter, is &ldquo;absurd to
reason.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>NOTE TO PAGE 12.</h2>
<p>It is of much importance to mark clearly how absolute, upon
Dr. M&rsquo;Caul&rsquo;s reading of Leviticus xviii. 18, is the
contradiction involved.&nbsp; I add, therefore:&mdash;Let it be
well observed that a time beyond that expressed by the words
&ldquo;<i>in her life-time</i>&rdquo; must be understood to be of
the essence of all the prohibitions.&nbsp; That is to say (and
the awful importance of the matter requires it to be stated
plainly), that it is incest and not adultery which is the subject
of the prohibitions throughout.&nbsp; A man is prohibited from
marrying his Mother not merely during his Father&rsquo;s life <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>time, but
always&mdash;his Sister, not merely, if she be married, and, if
so, during her husband&rsquo;s life-time, but always.&nbsp; So of
the Brother&rsquo;s Wife, and the rest.&nbsp; Therefore according
to the interpretation insisted upon, the collision is, as stated
in the text, a complete contradiction; a universal negative on
the one side met by a particular affirmative on the other, just
as if one should say, negatively, &ldquo;No horses are
black,&rdquo; and then immediately add, affirmatively,
&ldquo;Some horses are black.&rdquo;&nbsp; For, the statements
drawn out in full, including the case by parity of reasoning from
verse 16, would stand thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>Thou shalt not take thy Brother&rsquo;s Wife, whether in thy
Brother&rsquo;s life-time or not.</p>
<p>Thou shalt not take thy Wife&rsquo;s Sister, whether in her
Sister&rsquo;s life-time or not.</p>
<p>Thou mayest take thy Wife&rsquo;s Sister, if it be not in her
Sister&rsquo;s life-time.</p>
<p>Such is the over-riding demanded by Dr. M&rsquo;Caul&rsquo;s
position, and necessary to the argument if this 18th verse is to
be made in any way available for the purpose of the promoters of
the change in our marriage law.&nbsp; The improbability of such a
contradiction within two verses, including an assumed change in
the subject matter, from incest to adultery, in a continuous
catalogue of the enormities denounced, can, as it appears to me,
hardly be exaggerated.</p>
<p>There is one consideration further to which it may be well to
call attention, viz., that the <i>translation</i> of Lev. xviii.
18, is not to be confused with its <i>interpretation</i>.&nbsp;
Dr. M&rsquo;Caul naturally insists much upon the translation, and
in addition to his own critical judgment, allowed to be of great
weight from his known eminence as an Hebrew Scholar, he gives
many authorities in favour of the rendering as it stands in the
text of our authorized version.&nbsp; Still it is to be remarked
that the authorities whom he cites for the translation are by no
means at one with him as to the interpretation.&nbsp; This point
will be found very fully treated of in the second letter of the
present Lord Chancellor to the Dean of Westminster, printed in
1861, <a name="citation40"></a><a href="#footnote40"
class="citation">[40]</a> and, if I remember rightly, it was also
examined and the result put very forcibly by the Bishop of Exeter
in the postscript to his letter to the late Bishop of Lichfield,
published, I believe, in 1860, where it is observantly noted that
of all our Reformers cited by Dr. M&rsquo;Caul as having accepted
the authorized version as to the rendering of Lev. xviii. 18,
there is not one who has gone with him in the application of it
which he advocates, inasmuch as they have all either explicitly
or implicitly received our table of prohibited degrees: a proof
that even from Dr. M&rsquo;Caul&rsquo;s premise, as to the
translation, they have not come to his conclusion as to the
interpretation.&nbsp; And it is plainly in the interpretation,
not in the mere translation, that the above-mentioned
contradiction is involved.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
